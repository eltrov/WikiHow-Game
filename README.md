# WikiHow-Game
This tool pulls random images from WikiHow articles using PowerShell.

To use simply run the Game Maker.ps1 script. 

By default, it will pull ten images from ten different articles on WikiHow and put them in a numbered folder with each image numbered 1 - 10.
The script also creates a Pages.txt file that includes the image number and title of each page it came from.

This originated as an idea for an improv game but in general the image resolution on WikiHow is too low to do what I had originally intended.
